# Performance Optimization Summary

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Next.js Configuration
- Enabled image optimization with WebP and AVIF formats
- Configured proper device and image sizes for responsive images
- Enabled SWC minification for faster builds
- Enabled compression for better loading times

### 2. YouTube Video Optimization
- Implemented lazy loading for YouTube iframes (2-second delay)
- Used `loading="lazy"` attribute for iframes
- Added proper preconnect and dns-prefetch for YouTube domains
- Maintained thumbnail fallbacks for better LCP

### 3. Script Loading Optimization
- Converted Yandex Metrika to use Next.js Script component
- Ensured all analytics scripts use `afterInteractive` strategy
- Preserved Google Analytics and Yandex integrations

### 4. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
- Implemented dynamic imports for non-critical components
- Added loading placeholders for better UX
- Reduced initial bundle size by deferring non-essential components

### 5. Resource Preloading
- Added preconnect for YouTube domains
- Created custom document for font preloading
- Added dns-prefetch for external domains

### 6. Build Optimization
- Updated browserslist database to latest version
- Maintained SWC minification for faster builds

## Preserved Integrations
✅ Google Analytics - Preserved and optimized
✅ Yandex Metrika - Preserved and optimized  
✅ YouTube embeds - Preserved with performance improvements
✅ Google Site Verification - Preserved

## Performance Impact
- Reduced initial YouTube iframe loading impact
- Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) by deferring video loading
- Better Core Web Vitals through code splitting
- Maintained all existing functionality and integrations

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Image Optimization**: Convert all images to WebP format
2. **Font Optimization**: Implement font-display: swap for better FCP
3. **CDN Setup**: Consider using a CDN for static assets
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement service worker for offline caching
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify optimization opportunities

## Testing
Run the following command to test the optimized build:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The website should now load faster while maintaining all existing functionality and integrations.
