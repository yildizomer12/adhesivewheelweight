    "intro": "The final automated stage in our production line involves preparing the precisely cutting segments by Chopping and Marking Machine for market readiness, particularly focusing on Adhesive Wheel Weights.The final automation stage in our production line involves the precise stacking and packaging of the cut segments, with a particular focus on the Adhesive Wheel Weights, making them ready for market. Our sophisticated taping and packaging machine meticulously applies high-performance adhesive tape, transforming the segments into Self-adhesive Balancing Weights.\n This process is optimized for producing Steel Wheel Weights, especially popular Fe stick on wheel weight types designed for modern wheel weights for aluminum wheels. The machine then accurately arranges these Steel Balancing Weights onto release liner strips and prepares them for final packaging, ensuring product integrity and ease of use for technicians. The result is a finished product ready for distribution .\nOur Taping and Packaging Machine is aligned with the latest industry standards. Similar to the high-efficiency machines used by leading manufacturers like 3M (USA), Plombco (USA) known for their advanced automation and precision in wheel weight production, our machine offers superior performance.\nIf you want to compare our production with the process in this video, please visit our <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4on1c-EqHQ&list=PLGiOF2X6GljlJMjUlvRu8lDKTwnZJ1dvc'>youtube channel</a> ",
