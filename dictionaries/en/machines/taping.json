    "intro": "Following the <a href='/en/wire-flattening-machine'>initial wire flattening</a>, the precisely shaped steel profile enters our advanced chopping and marking stage. Our dedicated wheel weight machine performs high-speed, high-accuracy cutting, transforming the continuous flattened wire into individual segments destined to become Automotive Wheel Weights. This wheel weight manufacturing machine ensures each Wheel weight piece meets exact length and weight specifications, critical for both OEM Wheel Weights and aftermarket applications, including precursors for Wheel weihgt stic on types. Markings indicating weight values can also be applied during this automated process. As leading wheel weights machine manufacturers and wheel weights machine producers, we guarantee consistency and precision in every semi-finished piece. These precisely cut segments are now ready for <a href='/en/taping-and-packaging-machine'>final processing</a>. Our machines is designed to compete with industry leaders such as: <a href='https://www.wegmann-automotive.com/'>Wegmann-Automotive (Germany)</a> and <a href='https://www.bendpak.com/'>Bendpak (USA)</a>,",
