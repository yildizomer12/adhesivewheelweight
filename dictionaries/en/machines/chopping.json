      "part2": "The final automated stage in our production line involves preparing the precisely cut segments using the Chopping and Marking Machine for market readiness, with a particular focus on Adhesive Wheel Weights. This stage ensures the precise stacking and packaging of the cut segments, preparing them for market. Our sophisticated taping and packaging machine applies high-performance adhesive tape, transforming the segments into Self-adhesive Balancing Weights. This process is optimized for producing Steel Wheel Weights, especially popular Fe stick-on wheel weight types, designed for modern wheel weights for aluminum wheels. The machine then accurately arranges these Steel Balancing Weights onto release liner strips and prepares them for final packaging, ensuring product integrity and ease of use for technicians. The result is a finished product ready for distribution.\n\nOur Taping and Packaging Machine aligns with the latest industry standards. Similar to the high-efficiency machines used by leading manufacturers like 3M (USA) and Plombco (USA), known for their advanced automation and precision in wheel weight production, our machine offers superior performance.\n\nTo compare our production process with this, please visit our <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@YILSAMAKINA'>YouTube channel</a>."
