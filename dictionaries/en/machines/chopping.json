Our dedicated wheel weight machine performs high-speed, high-accuracy cutting, transforming the continuous flattened wire into individual segments destined to become Automotive Wheel Weights.\n\nThis wheel weight manufacturing machine ensures each Wheel weight piece meets exact length and weight specifications, critical for both OEM Wheel Weights and aftermarket applications, including precursors for Wheel weihgt stic on types. Markings indicating weight values can also be applied during this automated process.\n\nAs leading wheel weights machine manufacturers and wheel weights machine producers, we guarantee consistency and precision in every semi-finished piece. These precisely cut segments are now ready for final processing.\n\nOur machines is designed to compete with industry leaders such as: <a href='https://shop.wegmann-automotive.com/en/'>Wegmann-Automotive (Germany)</a> and <a href='https://www.bendpak.com/'><![CDATA[<a href='https://www.bendpak.com/'>Bendpak (USA)</a>]]></a>, "
