      "part1": "After wire flattening, the semi-finished material moves to the Chopping and Marking Machine, where precision cutting and branding occur. This step transforms flattened wire into ready-to-assemble pieces, essential for producing Automotive Wheel Weights, including Clip-on Wheel Weights and Wheel Weight Stick-On types. Our machinery ensures high-quality OEM Wheel Weights through advanced technology, a standard expected from top wheel weight machine manufacturers. Whether you are looking for wheel weight manufacturing machines or a trusted wheel weights machine producer, we deliver unmatched performance.
